# **Semantic SuMa Docker Environment**

This repository contains a Dockerfile for building a containerized environment to set up and run the **Semantic SuMa** project with **RangeNetLib** and **TensorRT 8.x.x**. The container is based on NVIDIA's TensorRT image and includes dependencies for CUDA, cuDNN, ROS Noetic, OpenCV, and other necessary libraries.


## **Prerequisites**

My GPU: 4060Ti.

It's not necessary to have a 4060 Ti; you can try any of the 40 series GPUs.
